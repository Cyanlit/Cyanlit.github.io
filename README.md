## About Me

I am a senior Computer Science student with a focus on core computer science fundamentals and system-level thinking.

My academic training centers on data structures, algorithms, operating systems, computer organization, and software development. I am particularly interested in understanding how systems work at a structural level, from low-level implementation details to overall architecture design.

I value clarity, disciplined problem-solving, and careful reasoning in both coursework and projects.
